## Super Mario Text Game

This repository includes a small text-based Mario-style game written in Python. It
uses the `curses` module to draw the level in your terminal.

### How to run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed (the game was tested with Python 3.12).
2. Run the game with:

   ```bash
   python3 mario.py
   ```

   Use the arrow keys or `A`/`D` to move and `W` or the space bar to jump. Press
   `q` to quit.
